					<p style="font-weight: 600">Ingredients:</p>
					<p>1 (15.25oz) package cake mix</p>

					<p>1 bag candy melts (more if other colors desired*)</p>
				
				<p>*I found Wilton candy melts to be easiest to work with</p>

					<p style="text-align: left; font-weight: 400;"> Step 1: Prepare the cake as directed on the box.</p>
					<p style="text-align: left; font-weight: 400";>Step 2: While cake is still warm, cut off and remove the edges (this will prevent large crumbs in the balls). Crumble remaining cake in a large mixing bowl.</p>
					<p style="text-align: left; font-weight: 400;">Step 3: Add frosting to warm cake until it reaches a moist consistency that holds its shape. (I use only about 3/4 of the jar of frosting)</p>
					<p style="text-align: left; font-weight: 400;">Step 4: Roll cake mixture into desired size balls and freeze on baking sheet for at least one hour.</p>
					<p style="text-align: left; font-weight: 400;">Step 5: Decorating! This is mostly up to you. Follow the directions on the bag of candy melts for best results. I found that using 1-2 Tbsp of shortening helped to keep the coating from thickening too quickly while decorating.</p>

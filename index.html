				<p class="vertbig">I am a lifelong amateur baker with a passion for exploring and perfecting new bakes whenever I get the chance. Baking can be a way to relax, satisfy a craving, compete in some friendly competition, and much more. Whether you are serving dessert to hundreds of people or baking cookies with your grandchildren, there is something in baking for everyone. With these helpful tips and recipes, I hope to share some of the insights and delicious bakes I have discovered over the years. It is never too late to become a great baker!</p>
